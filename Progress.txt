Created a udp request function hat will send udp connection request to the torrent url server
Got the response
Now objective is to parse the response and store the connection id

parsed the connection response 

Now I have to send a announce request but for that I need a info hash , I need a complete info from torrent file 
{was using a hardcoded url , Ig I have to use to parse the torrent file using js/py}

I made a json file using py and getting all the information through that 

till infoHash done 
next files 

Found replacement for the json file refactored the code , but the issue still remains not getting any ip from announce response
